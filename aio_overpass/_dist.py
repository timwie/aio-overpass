    """
    Distance between two coordinates using equirectangular approximation.

    This uses just one trig and one sqrt function, which makes it very fast.
    It is useful for small distances (up to a few km), but inaccurate for larger
    distances, depending on distance, bearing, and latitude.

    Returns:
        approximate distance in meters between the two coordinates
