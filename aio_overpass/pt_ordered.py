    Produce ``OrderedRouteViews`` objects from a result set.

    Compared to ``collect_routes()``, this function tries to build the geometry representing the
    path travelled on every route from the first to last stop. If there are no holes in a route's
    relation, this can typically generate a single line string to represent the entire path of
    a route. Note that routes tagged with the PTv1 scheme will be ignored (in an effort to keep
    the implemenation as simple as possible).

    Since we cannot guarantee that relation members are ordered, we have to convert the route into
    a graph, and find the shortest paths between stops. The more complex the graph, and the more
    stops in a relation, the more expensive it is to generate those paths. Parallelizing this is
    highly recommended, even for a small amount of routes (see ``n_jobs``).

    You should use this instead of ``collect_routes()`` if you are particularly interested in a
    route's path. Here are some example use cases:
     - rendering a route's path between any two stops
     - measuring the route's travelled distance between any two stops
     - validating the order of ways in the relation

    Args:
        query: The query that produced a result set of route relations.
        perimeter: If set, ``stops`` and ``paths`` of resulting routes will be limited
                   to the exterior of this polygon. Any relation members in ``members``
                   will not be filtered.
        n_jobs: The number of workers that generate route geometries in parallel.
                Passing ``-1`` will start a worker for each CPU, ``-2`` will start one for
                each CPU but one, and the default ``1`` will not run any parallel workers at all.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the input query has no result set
        ImportError: if ``n_jobs != 1`` and the ``joblib`` extra is missing

    Walk the path to visit the next stop, and collect path nodes along the way.

    Repeated traversal of the edge (u, v) is discouraged by setting a large, arbitrary weight.

    members are supposed to be ordered, ways that are repeatedly traversed should appear more than
